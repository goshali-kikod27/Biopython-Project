(In Step 4, functional annotation of the protein was performed based on BLAST results.
The top BLAST hit identified the query sequence as Lysozyme C precursor.
Lysozyme C is a hydrolase enzyme (EC 3.2.1.17) that hydrolyzes β-1,4-glycosidic bonds in peptidoglycan of bacterial cell walls, leading to bacterial lysis.
It plays an important role in innate immunity and provides antimicrobial defense.)
