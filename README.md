# Biopython Project

## Title
Protein Sequence Analysis using Biopython

## Description
This project focuses on analyzing a protein sequence using Python and the Biopython library.
The protein sequence was obtained from the NCBI database and basic bioinformatics analysis was performed.

## Objective
To learn protein sequence analysis using Biopython.

## Data Source
Protein sequence collected from NCBI in FASTA format.

## Tools Used
- Python 3
- Biopython
- NCBI Database

## Methodology
1. Protein sequence was downloaded from NCBI.
2. Sequence was saved in FASTA format.
3. Biopython was used to read and analyze the sequence.
4. Output such as sequence length and basic details were obtained.

## Conclusion
This project helped in understanding the application of Biopython in bioinformatics
and improved practical knowledge of protein sequence analysis.# Biopython-Project
