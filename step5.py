(Biological interpretation of the identified protein indicates that Lysozyme C plays a crucial role in innate immunity.
It acts as an antibacterial enzyme by hydrolyzing peptidoglycan present in bacterial cell walls, leading to cell lysis.
The presence of this protein in body secretions such as tears and saliva highlights its importance as a first-line defense mechanism against pathogenic microorganisms.)
